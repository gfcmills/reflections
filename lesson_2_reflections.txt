What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise a repo, git starts tracking changes in it. If you don't initialise a repo, there is no way for git to track changes, which means it can't merge or revert to alternative versions. NB initialising creates a .git file in the folder which the repo is based on. In this folder, git tracks all the changes between different commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place to break down commits into logical chunks. This means you can commit a logically separated piece of work even if you've moved on to the next thing.
